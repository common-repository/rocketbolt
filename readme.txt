A zero-coding install of RocketBolt's contact tracking service into Wordpress websites.

== Description ==

See who's on your website and what pages they're looking at with contact tracking from [RocketBolt](http://rocketbolt.com).

Once you've installed RocketBolt's wordpress plugin, RocketBolt will begin "listening" for email addresses to be entered into any form on your website. When a user enters his/her email address, RocketBolt automatically builds a comprehensive profile of that person -- such as full name, company name, location, and social media profiles -- then stores the contact in RocketBolt's CRM (or the CRM of your choice).

When RocketBolt identifies a contact on your website, you'll be able to see all of that person's activity during the initial visit as well as all subsequent visits. In addition, RocketBolt can alert you instantly whenever that person returns to your website so you always know when your contacts are thinking about you.

The RocketBolt Wordpress plugin pairs perfectly with RocketBolt's email tracking plugins for [Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rocketbolt-email-tracking/pkapfpgbgfcojflnfmhnplkkkcdcmkfj) and Outlook.

When you send a link to your website in an email, RocketBolt will be able to tell you if the recipient clicked it to visit your website. Once the person is on your website, you'll be able to see all the pages visited as well as all return visits.
